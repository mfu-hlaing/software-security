# Live Quiz — self-hosted Kahoot-style game

Real-time, host-paced, speed+accuracy-scored MCQ game. It's a small multi-teacher platform: each
teacher registers an account (invite-gated), builds and manages their own question sets from
Markdown — same source format as the course's other item banks (a `## <topic>` heading followed
by `N. <stem> a) opt · b) opt ✓ · c) opt · d) opt` question lines) — and starts games from them.
Students still join anonymously by PIN, no account needed on that side. Built to remove
Kahoot/Quizizz's free-tier player caps as a blocker at N≈120 and to work for remote/hybrid access
(MFU); **decided 2026-07-29 as the primary quiz mechanism for this course** (Kahoot/Quizizz kept
as fallback — see "Relationship to the Kahoot/Quizizz export path" below) — see
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-10-live-quiz-platform-design.md` for the full design
rationale (the current multi-teacher platform design; the earlier `2026-07-06-live-quiz-design.md`
is the superseded pre-pivot single-classroom draft).

The interface is a KOSEN·KMITL-branded, projector-first host screen and a phone-first player
screen: a live lobby that fills as students join, a ticking countdown, big answer tiles coded by
**colour + shape + text** (so they read for colour-blind students and from the back of the hall),
a live answer-distribution bar chart with the correct answer revealed, a running leaderboard, and
a podium finish. It respects `prefers-reduced-motion` and targets WCAG-AA contrast.

## Run it

```
export INVITE_CODE=letmein   # anyone who has this code can register a teacher account
cd labs/live-quiz && docker compose up --build
```

- Register: open `http://localhost:5050/register`, enter the invite code plus a username and
  password. Registration is closed (the form rejects everyone) until `INVITE_CODE` is set to
  something non-empty — the server also logs a startup warning if it's unset.
- Build a set: after registering you land in `http://localhost:5050/console`. Paste or upload a
  Markdown question set there (same `## <topic>` / `N. <stem> a) ... ✓` format as the course's
  other item banks), give it a title, and save it.
- Host a game: from the console, start a game from one of your own sets — this is what issues the
  6-digit PIN. `/host` itself is login-gated and just redirects you back to the console; it is no
  longer an open "pick a topic, Create game" page anyone can reach.
- Players: open `http://localhost:5050/`, enter the PIN + a pseudonymous nickname (not a real
  name — same PDPA posture as the CTFd scoreboard).

To run it **without Docker** for local dev (e.g. macOS AirPlay squats on port 5000):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
DB_PATH=./dev.db INVITE_CODE=letmein SECRET_KEY=dev PORT=5057 python app.py
# then open http://localhost:5057/register
```

`DB_PATH` points SQLite at a local file (created on first run) instead of the container's `/data`
volume; `INVITE_CODE` opens registration for this run; `PORT` picks a free port.

## Guided Weeks 1–6 mastery path

`/learn/software-security/mastery` connects the first six weeks into the same
five-step learning loop each time: **Learn → Explore → Lab → Defend → Check**.
It links the canonical slides and worksheets rather than copying them, includes
all 13 core Weeks 1–6 simulations, and carries one NoteVault defence mission
through the sequence. Eight existing first-party simulations from later or
parallel cryptography material appear in explicitly labelled **Beyond Weeks
1–6 syllabus** panels; they are optional transfer labs, not hidden assessment
scope. The six practice banks are original, ungraded retrieval practice; they
do not reuse the graded weekly questions.

Every week also has four visible explanation tiers (**Foundation → Core →
Advanced → Beyond syllabus**), a code-native attack/defence mechanism map, and
three evidence-gated mission checkpoints worth 100 + 150 + 250 motivational XP.
The six ranks total 3000 XP. Checkpoint completion is self-attested and stored
only as public checkpoint IDs in browser `localStorage`; there is no progress
POST route, account, identity field, evidence upload, grade, or leaderboard.
Hints expose a reasoning direction, never a payload, flag, secret, or completed
patch. The mastery and practice scripts make no network requests, and their CSP
permits only first-party scripts with `form-action 'none'`.

Shared lab targets are optional. Without configuration, each week links back to
its repository lab guide for local use. For an internal/VPN deployment, set a
single base URL:

```bash
MASTERY_LAB_BASE_URL=https://labs.vpn.internal
```

This resolves Week 1 as `/week01`, through Week 6 as `/week06`. A week-specific
URL takes precedence when targets do not share that shape:

```bash
MASTERY_WEEK04_LAB_URL=http://10.70.4.25:8080
```

Only absolute `http://` or `https://` values are accepted. The overview and
weekly pathway use a first-party-script-only CSP for local checkpoint progress.
Practice has a separate equivalent CSP, makes no network request or database
write, sets no identity cookie, and may remember only selected option numbers in
the browser's local storage. “Reset this practice” removes that local state.

Configured lab URLs are instructor-managed, resettable **team sandboxes** or
focused browser landings. They are not per-student virtual machines and never
run arbitrary student branches. In particular, Week 2 scanner/fuzzer evidence
and Week 3 hash/KDF/AEAD evidence require the checked-out repository and local
tooling; a browser CTA cannot manufacture command output. NoteVault hardening
is implemented, tested, committed, and submitted through each team's own repo
workflow. The Week 5 supplied defended app intentionally leaves CSRF observable;
the complete token-backed CSRF defence belongs in the learner's NoteVault work.

## Deploying for real classroom/remote use

This needs to be reachable outside `localhost` for remote/hybrid students (unlike this course's
other Docker-first labs). Deploy on the existing CTFd challenge-host (already has a public IP +
TLS reverse proxy) rather than standing up new infrastructure — see
`instructor/platform-build/deploy/GO-LIVE-CHECKLIST.md` for that host's setup. Set a real
`SECRET_KEY` via the environment (do not use the `docker-compose.yml` default in production).

## Running as a shared platform (multiple teachers)

This is no longer a single-classroom tool with one shared host URL — it's meant to run once per
deployment and serve several teachers, each with their own login and question sets:

1. Set a strong `SECRET_KEY` and an `INVITE_CODE` via the environment before bringing the
   container up (do not use the `docker-compose.yml` defaults in production).
2. Share the invite code, out-of-band, with the teachers who should get accounts.
3. Each teacher registers once at `/register`, signs in at `/login`, and builds their own
   question sets in `/console` (paste or upload Markdown, same format as before).
4. Each teacher starts games from their own sets in the console; a game's results CSV
   (`/host/<pin>/export`) can only be pulled by the teacher who created that game.
5. Students still join anonymously at `/` by PIN — no account needed on that side.

**Back up the `live-quiz-data` named volume.** It's the only place teacher accounts and question
sets persist; losing it means every teacher has to re-register and re-paste their sets. Set
`COOKIE_SECURE=1` once the deployment is actually served over TLS — session cookies otherwise flow
over plain HTTP, which is fine for local dev but not for a public-IP host.

## Accessibility & resilience notes

- **Answers never rely on colour alone** — every option carries a distinct shape (triangle /
  diamond / circle / square), a text label, and an A/B/C/D key. All motion is disabled under
  `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Reconnect is seamless.** Players are keyed by `(PIN, nickname)`, so a dropped phone that
  rejoins resumes its score (the score shown is the server's, not a client guess). If a question is
  live when they rejoin, the server re-sends it and the client keeps any answer already locked in,
  rather than wiping it or stranding them on a blank screen.
- **A closed tab no longer skews the room.** A socket disconnect marks that player away, so they
  stop counting toward the projector's "answered" tally and the connected-player count. Every round
  is bounded by the 20-second timer and ends early once the still-connected players have all
  answered. (A disconnect is deliberately *not* treated as an instant "everyone answered" — a brief
  wifi blip of the last un-answered player must not rob them of the round.)
- **Answers are rejected once the round is revealed**, and nicknames are length-capped and
  control-char-stripped server-side, so neither a late tap nor a bypassed client `maxlength` can
  score or corrupt the export.

## Scoring

Wrong answers always score 0. Correct answers score `1000 * (1 - (time_taken/20) / 2)` — full
marks for an instant answer, half marks for one submitted right at the 20-second limit.

## Data handling

Player nicknames are pseudonymous by design — never map them to a real student roster inside
this tool. Results export as a CSV (`nickname, total_score, correct_count, avg_response_time_ms`)
that the instructor manually joins against the real roster afterward, same as CTFd's flow.

## Graded weekly quiz (`/assess`) — replaces Google Forms

**A different mode from the live game, not an extension of it.** The game is
synchronous, anonymous and in-memory; this is asynchronous, identified, persisted,
and its scores become part of someone's grade. They share a process and a
database; they deliberately do not share an identity model.

Decided 2026-07-29 alongside bringing Classroom and the Master Gradebook Sheet
onto our own platform — see the override box in
`instructor/FULL-PLATFORM-DESIGN.md` §4.5.

**Teacher:** `/assess` → publish from a question set → issue codes → mark short
answers → export.
**Student:** `/quiz` → enter the code from their slip → one question per page → done.

### Proctoring: settings became invariants

`instructor/quizzes/weekly/README.md` lists the Form settings that made copying
hard. Every one of them is now enforced server-side, which is a stronger
position, not an equivalent one:

| Google Form setting | Here |
|---|---|
| shuffle question order | per-student permutation, frozen at attempt start |
| shuffle option order | same — and answers are stored in **canonical** index space, so grading never depends on what the student saw |
| one question per page | the cursor lives on the server |
| disable "back" | the cursor is **advance-only** — not a browser hint a student can defeat |
| 1 response per account | `UNIQUE(assessment_id, student_id)` + a one-time code burned on redemption |
| collect email | the roster's `student_id` **is** the identity — the same handle as CTFd, WireGuard and the gradebook |
| release scores later | `assessments.released` |

**The one real trade: we own the access path instead of Google.** That is the
point of the exercise.

### Why a one-time code and not a student password

A student password would be a **fifth** credential to distribute, reset and own —
on top of the CTFd account, the WireGuard `.conf`, and the institutional Google
account. And per `quizzes/weekly/README.md` §"Make copying hard" item 1, the real
control is *"in class, timed, devices away"* — so what's needed is **attribution,
not remote authentication**. A code that dies on redemption needs no store and no
reset path, and makes one-attempt a `UNIQUE` constraint rather than a session check.

Re-issuing is idempotent: adding a late enrolment does not invalidate the sheets
already printed for everyone else.

### Two things that would silently corrupt a term

- **Questions are frozen at publish.** The teacher's question set is a living
  document; an assessment is a snapshot of it. Without this, editing the item bank
  while a quiz is open rewrites questions under students who are mid-attempt.
- **A student who never sat it exports as blank, not 0.** "Didn't sit it" and "sat
  it and scored nothing" are different facts and only the teacher can decide which
  applies. `results.csv` also carries `fully_graded` — a partially-marked quiz has
  a real earned total that is **not** a final mark.

### Exports

| Endpoint | Feeds |
|---|---|
| `results.csv` | `instructor/gradebook/` — `percent` is 0–100, per `GRADEBOOK.md` |
| `q6.csv` | `instructor/quizzes/weekly/verify_q6.py`, so Q6 keeps being checked against each student's own CTFd capture rather than becoming a second unverified path |
| `codes.csv` | the print-and-cut sheet — **per-student, never a shared list** |

### Verified end-to-end

Beyond 48 unit + route tests, a real run against a live server using the course's
**actual** `instructor/quizzes/weekly/item-bank.md`: published a 5-MCQ + Q6 quiz,
issued 3 codes, walked 2 students through over real HTTP (each saw a **different
question order and different option permutations**), left the 3rd deliberately
absent, marked one Q6 3/3 and the other 0/3, and fed the resulting `results.csv`
straight into `gradebook.compute()` → `FINAL 74.45 B` / `72.70 B`, with the absent
student correctly refused as "nothing to enter". Re-entering a burned code was
refused.

## Worksheet submission + rubric grading (`/work`, `/submit`) — replaces Classroom

**Teacher:** `/work` → set an assignment (rubric defaults to the worksheets' own
20/40/25/15 = 100) → issue codes → mark → export.
**Student:** `/submit` → code from their slip → upload, replace, add the required
AI-disclosure note, read feedback once released.

### The download endpoint is the security-critical route

Everything a student uploads is attacker-controlled bytes, and the teacher who
reads it is signed in with the session that can change every mark. So uploads are
**never rendered inline**: `Content-Type: application/octet-stream` (never the
uploaded type, never guessed from the extension), `Content-Disposition:
attachment`, `nosniff`, and `Content-Security-Policy: sandbox; default-src 'none'`.

Verified for real by uploading
`<svg …><script>alert(document.cookie)</script></svg>` and fetching it **as the
teacher**: served as an opaque download with the script still inert bytes. Another
student and an anonymous request both get **404**, not 403 — a probe learns nothing.

### A student never names a file on disk

`store_file` generates the on-disk name from `secrets.token_hex`; the student's
filename is stored for display only. Traversal, collision and extension-confusion
are impossible by construction rather than filtered. Proven by uploading
`../../../../etc/passwd` — it landed as a flat 48-hex file alongside the others,
and shows in the UI as `passwd`.

### Backups: the trap that would only surface during a restore

Submissions are **files on a volume**, so the SQLite dump contains none of them.
Restoring the database alone gives you submission rows pointing at files that no
longer exist — a restore that looks successful and has lost every student's work.
`backup-ctfd-db.sh` therefore tars the upload directory in the same run, keeps
those archives **180 days** (not 14 — a mark can be disputed long after), and its
restore instructions say to restore both or neither. Round-trip verified:
3 files archived, restored, bytes identical.

### Not a zero

A student who never handed in exports as blank, never `0`. **Late is shown, not
deducted** — SUBMISSION.md's −10%/day is the teacher's call, applied once,
deliberately. An unmarked rubric row is `NULL`, so `fully_graded=0` travels with
the row and a partial mark can't be imported as a final one.

## Relationship to the Kahoot/Quizizz export path

**DECIDED 2026-07-29: this app is the PRIMARY quiz mechanism**, not Kahoot/Quizizz — their
free tier caps at ~40-50 players/game, which forces an N≈120 cohort to be split and re-run
per section; this app has no such cap. `instructor/quizzes/kahoot/make_kahoot_import.py`
(exports to real Kahoot/Quizizz) still exists and still works as a **fallback** for when this
deployment itself is down.

## Known limitations (not blocking for classroom use)

`/host`, `/console`, and `/host/<pin>/export` all require a teacher login now (see "Running as a
shared platform" above), and export is further scoped so only the teacher who created a given game
can download its results CSV. This used to be a real gap — noted here since an earlier version of
this doc flagged it — but it's resolved as of this build.

- **Nicknames aren't unique.** Two students who pick the same nickname share one score row (and one
  reconnect slot). Harmless for casual play; if it matters for grading, ask students to use their
  pseudonymous student code. A future fix would reject or auto-suffix a duplicate at join time.

Resolved since the first build (kept here as a record): CSV export now neutralizes spreadsheet
formula-injection prefixes; answers are rejected once a round is revealed (no post-timeout scoring);
reconnecting mid-question re-shows the question and keeps the score server-authoritative; the
countdown steps rather than sweeps under `prefers-reduced-motion`; brand-orange chrome uses the
deep shade so white text on it clears WCAG-AA; and host/console/export access — previously
unauthenticated, trusting only PIN secrecy — now requires a teacher login, with exports further
scoped to the creating teacher.
