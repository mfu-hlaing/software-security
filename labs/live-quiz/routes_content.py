routes_content.py — the public course content plane (`/learn`).

Replaces Classroom's *distribute the material* role. Read-only, no auth, no
student data, no upload: the safest surface on the platform, and deliberately so
— it is the only part students hit before they have any credential.

Content is rendered by `content.py`, which escapes every byte before recognising
any markdown. That ordering matters here more than anywhere else on the platform:
`labs/week05-xss-client-side/worksheet.md` ships `<script>alert(document.cookie)
</script>` as course content, and these routes share an origin with the teacher's
authenticated grading session.

Belt and braces on top of the renderer: a per-response CSP that forbids inline
and remote script outright, so even a renderer regression cannot execute
anything. `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` stops a browser deciding a response
is script on its own.
