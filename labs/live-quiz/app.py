    This used to render the live-quiz join screen, because that is all the app
    was when it was written. It is now the smallest part of it — the same app
    serves 19 weeks of course documents, the graded weekly quiz, worksheet
    hand-in and the simulations. A student typing the bare hostname landed on a
    "Game PIN / Nickname" box with no way to reach any of that, which is the
    exact confusion that renaming the host to learn.* was meant to remove.

    So `/` is the course front door and the live game moved to `/play`. Both the
    host screen's projected join URL (static/host.js) and the front door's
    "Join a live game" link point there, so neither audience loses a step.

    weeks — a fine second click, a poor first one: it answers "which week?" when
    the student's actual question is "where do I go?", and it says nothing about
    the quiz, the hand-in or the arena until you scroll past every week. The home
