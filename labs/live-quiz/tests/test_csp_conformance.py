"""Every page must be able to RUN under the CSP it is served with.

The defect that made this file necessary: the app-plane CSP (`script-src 'self'`
with no `'unsafe-inline'`) shipped while host.html still started the projector
screen from an inline `<script>initHost(…)</script>`. The browser dropped that
script. Nothing threw, nothing logged, no response changed — the projector simply
never joined its socket room, so the lobby stayed at 0 players and Start game
never enabled. It reached production and 353 tests stayed green, because every
one of them asserts on the RESPONSE and a blocked inline script is a policy
decision, not an error.

Same policy, same silence, four more casualties found alongside it:
  * set_form.html's parse preview (inline <script>)
  * console.html's delete confirmation (inline onsubmit=)
  * the answer colours on /host and /play (style="--o:var(--a-red)" from JS)
  * the response-distribution bar widths (style="--w:NN%")

So these tests do not check behaviour; they check that the MARKUP is compatible
with the POLICY. The two live in different files and nothing else connects them.

`'unsafe-inline'` would make all of this pass and is exactly the wrong fix: these
pages carry a password form and a teacher's authenticated session, on the same
origin as a content plane that renders course markdown containing real XSS
payloads. The markup comes to the policy, never the other way round.
